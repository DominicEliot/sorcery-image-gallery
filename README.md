# Github Pages Gallery
This repo makes a Sorcery image gallery for github pages!

### Note:
The images generated appear blank because they are generated as very small (2x2 pixel) images to make the page generation fast. However, the download links work, and the images follow the same path as the official gallery on google docs, so they can be progamatically selected too.
